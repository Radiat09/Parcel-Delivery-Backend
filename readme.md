# Parcel-Delivery-Backend

## Project Overview

This repository contains the backend application for a parcel delivery service. It's built using TypeScript, Express.js, and Node.js, providing a robust and scalable foundation for managing parcel delivery operations.

## Key Features & Benefits

- **RESTful API:** Provides a set of APIs for managing parcels, users, and delivery routes.
- **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and improves code maintainability.
- **Express.js:** Simplifies routing and middleware management.
- **Modular Design:** Organized project structure for easy navigation and modification.
- **Database Connectivity:** Integrates with MongoDB for persistent data storage.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Includes user authentication and authorization features (though details are in progress, as indicated by the session secret).

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** (Version >= 16 recommended) - [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn:** (usually installed with Node.js)
- **MongoDB:** A database instance for data storage. Can be a local instance or a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.
- **TypeScript:** (installed as a dev dependency - see package.json).

## Installation & Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Parcel-Delivery-Backend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file (if one doesn't exist) or modify existing environment variables. The following environment variables are likely used (although specific variable names are not visible in the provided file snippets, adapt this section based on your actual implementation):

    ```
    PORT=3000 # or any available port
    DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/parcel-delivery # Your MongoDB connection string
    SESSION_SECRET=YourSecreetKey # Change this for security!
    # Add any other necessary environment variables here
    ```

    **Important:** Replace `YourSecreetKey` with a strong, randomly generated secret key for session management.

4.  **Database Setup:**

    Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible. Update the `DB_URL` in your `.env` file to point to your MongoDB database.

5.  **Build the Project:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript.

6.  **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command starts the development server with live reloading, making development easier.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

The application exposes a RESTful API. While detailed API documentation is not included in the provided files, you can infer some endpoints based on the `src/app/routes` directory.

**Example (Hypothetical) - Get All Parcels:**

`GET /parcels` - Retrieves a list of all parcels.

**Example (Hypothetical) - Create a New Parcel:**

`POST /parcels` - Creates a new parcel. Request body should be in JSON format with parcel details.

**Note:** You will need to inspect the routing configuration in `src/app/routes` to determine the exact API endpoints and request/response formats. Consider using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to document the API.

## Configuration Options

The application's behavior can be configured through environment variables. Here's a summary of key configuration options:

| Variable         | Description                           | Example                                     |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |
| `PORT`           | The port on which the server listens. | `3000`                                      |
| `DB_URL`         | The MongoDB connection string.        | `mongodb://localhost:27017/parcel-delivery` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Secret key for express-session        | "YourSecreetKey"                            |
